# Projeto10_TrackIt
This is a single page application (SPA) project created to make it easier to practice and track your good habits.

To achieve this goal, the [ReactJS](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start), [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) library were used.

This is the 10th project made by me to 
"[bootcamp de desenvolvimento web full stack - Responde a√≠/Driven](https://driven.com.br/)" 
(full-stack web development).
